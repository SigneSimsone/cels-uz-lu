                    June is here, the warm and sunny weather of summer, the whole garden is green and the flowers are starting to bloom... It sounds great! You could relax, sunbathe and enjoy the cool weather with friends, without stress... But for students, unfortunately, June is not a rest, but a month filled with exams. In my dreams I am in summer, but in reality - studies, studies, studies...
                    
                    So my route to the University of Latvia starts from this place every day. In this school year, I had to go to lectures, seminars or practical work every day. However, when there is an opportunity and the weather is warm, I like to complete the study assignments and prepare for exams during the session in the garden, in the fresh air with birdsongs in the background.
                    
                    On the other hand, when I started studying at the university, it was September 2020 and then just a few months ago, in March, the pandemic had started, and I spent all my study time right here - at my home - and the "road to the University" was only virtual, connecting to lectures remotely , getting to know the course of studies and the environment only through my computer and getting to know my fellow students in the chat.

                <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                    Āgenskalns market has acquired such a modern and attractive appearance only recently. An impressive restoration was completed last year and a beautiful interior has been created with ornate chandeliers adorning the market premises. It brought life back not only to the market itself, but also to the surrounding area.
                    
                    Currently, the market is not only a place to buy a variety of products - meat, fish, vegetables and fruits from local farmers and home producers, bread and milk and various other fresh products, but it is also a great place to sit with friends, family or alone and enjoy delicious food and drinks both from local entrepreneurs and from the cuisines of different nations, for example, you can taste pizza from "Vīnkalni" or borscht from Ukrainians.
                    
                    On the other hand, on holidays, you can often meet various small producers and young designers of jewelry, works of art, candles, and other handmade goods, as well as participate in an book exchange. Various events, creative workshops, exhibitions and concerts are also often held throughout the seasons.

                <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                    Māras pond is a very popular place among the residents of Āgenskalns. On the path around the pond, you can see not only cyclists, but also many other athletes, including runners. This is also my favorite running training route. I can tell you from experience that the path around the pond is exactly 1 kilometer and 370 meters long.
                    
                    But this is also a great place to walk for young and old. It is often observed that both children and adults enjoy feeding the ducks and swans living in the pond, and it is quite a family activity. In the spring, you could also see the young swans here, which are not much different from their parents in terms of height.
                    
                    There is also a bike path that starts in Bieriņi and continues to Arkādija Park. The bike path in its current form was created here relatively recently. I know from my father's stories and the diplomas of his competitions that I have seen, that at the end of the sixties, instead of the current bicycle path, there was a motorcycle track in Bieriņi, where competitions with mopeds were also held.

                    A little further from the Māras Pond is the Arkādijas Park. The park has been created artificially, the bed of the Mārupīte river flowing through it has been changed, but the park definitely stands out among the others with the many twists and turns of the river, waterfalls and several bridges built over the Mārupīte. This is definitely one of the most scenic parks in the city.
                    
                    On November 18 of last year, in honor of Latvia's holiday, a celebration and a concert of Riga choirs took place here. Since I sing in a mixed choir, I also had the opportunity to participate in this event. Such concerts were held in several neighborhoods of Riga, so that the celebration would take place not only in the center near the Freedom Monument, as it usually happens, but there would be several official celebration places throughout Riga and its surroundings, for example in the Arkādija Park, in the park of the Culture Palace "Ziemeļblāzma", in Latgale Park and near the VEF Culture Palace. The visitors of the event had the opportunity to watch the broadcast from the Freedom Monument, and also had the opportunity to sing along with the choirs, as not only the Latvian national anthem was performed, but also popular choir songs, such as "Lec, saulīte!" and "Saule, Pērkons, Daugava".

                    Despite the park's dark past (the last public execution in Latvia was carried out here in 1946) and political and ideological problems related to the monument dedicated to the Soviet army, the importance of the park is more focused on active leisure.
                    
                    At the moment, the area around the former monument is closed, because the work of arranging the square after the demolition of the monument is still in progress, but several paths for sports are open around it, where people also like to run, ride a bicycle or roller skates, or do gymnastics on the grass - both individually and in organized groups, for which anyone interested can apply. In the warm months, roller skates can also be rented here, but in the snowy winter period, a cross-country skiing track is created here.
                    
                    Across Bāriņu Street, the territory of Park of Victory continues, where in the spring you can also see the beautiful blossoming of the sakura garden. It's a great place and time to get beautiful pictures and feel a little like in Japan.

                <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                    It is a very interesting and unusual view of the city, including the bridges of Riga, looking at them from the Daugava. It feels quite surreal to be in the center of the city but so close to the water of the wide river. Trips with SUP boards along the Daugava and the city canal are a great opportunity to catch this feeling and see the city in new colors.
                    
                    I see Riga's bridges everyday only when driving over them by car or public transport, but special feelings can be experienced not only during a trip along the river, but also every spring during the Riga Marathon, when you run along the streets and bridges of Riga, when they are filled only with runners. In my opinion, these are unique feelings and experiences that I never forget and that I look forward to every year in new competitions.
                    
                    During the marathon, I also noticed an interesting fact about bridges - in the rush of everyday life, anyone probably doesn't pay attention to it, but while running I could definitely feel that the Stone Bridge is significantly steeper than the Vansu Bridge.

                    At the moment, the main building of the university is my faculty, where I am studying computer science, but it has not always been my first association with this building, because apart from studies, this place always reminds me of bright and festive events. I have attended several graduations - for my sister, brother and cousin in this building, as well as in the Great and Small Halls, I have had several choir performances, as a result of which I also got the opportunity to participate in the 2018 Song and Dance Festival as well as this summer's festival. The most memorable moment at this year's show was definitely the opportunity to perform the song "Sasala jūrīna" with the choir together with Ance Krauze as the soloist of the song.
                    
                    There is also an interesting tradition among students about the main entrance of the university - in order to finish your studies, you must not go up the central stairs. This belief is passed down from generation to generation – we were told this on the first day of our studies at the university and it was also relevant, for example, about 15 years ago when my sister was studying at the University.
